   <p>La situation contemporaine voit l’affaiblissement idéologique des États-nations par deux processus concomitants qui loin de s’opposer se nourrissent mutuellement : mondialisation économique et réaction identitaire. D’où le repli des penseurs républicains sur la forme nécessaire d’une « identité nationale », seul lieu possible d’une démocratie comme auto-détermination collective contre les périls du libéralisme et du communautarisme. Cependant, à l’opposé de la conception « procédurale » qui découle logiquement d’une « société des individus », la démocratie doit se comprendre comme fondée sur un monde de significations communes, conditions sociohistoriques d’une valeur prééminente accordée à l’individualité. A contrario, les « communautés modernes » ne sont souvent que des « individus collectifs », juxtaposition de membres pourvus d’une caractéristique identique. La mise au jour du soubassement « holiste » de toute société permet de saisir le rôle de l’État-nation, non seulement figure de l’englobant collectif, mais surtout ouverture vers la précédence de l’institution sociale du sens dans sa dimension implicite.</p>

   <p>People come here and ask me who are the Inuit? I don’t know what they want me to say but probably they want us to be who they think we should be? We simply want to be who we are. Just Inuit.</p>
  <p>Inuit stories, when written down, generally make no sense.</p>
  <p>Un bon archiviste est plus utile à la nation qu’un général d’artillerie.</p>
  <p>As soon as one began to ask about matters outside the sphere of tangible reality, the views expressed were so contradictory that one could make nothing of them together. Nothing definite was known, nor did it seem to matter that the wise men of the tribe held different views one from another.</p>
  <p>You […] must know that human beings differ. The Harvaqtormiut know many things we do not know, and we know many things they do not. Therefore you must not compare the Harvaqtormiut with us, for their knowledge is not our knowledge, as our knowledge is not theirs. Therefore we tell you only what we know from our village.</p>
  <p>Our history is about […] dealing with change as well as the causes and consequences of change forced on us through colonialism ; and about how we have re-established control over our cultural, economic and political destiny through land claims and self government. Above all, the story of Inuit is about how we as a culture are able to live in balance with the natural world. This is a story that we must begin to tell for ourselves. Unfortunately until now, most of the research on our culture and history has been done by individuals who come from outside our culture. Since the information that these individuals collected was seldom made available to us, the image held by much of the outside world about who we are is usually someone else’s creation, not ours. […] In the meantime we will reinterpret the information gathered by others to help us speak about ourselves.</p>
  <p>The problem with the way in which traditional stories have been recorded in print stems from the fact that cultural specifics have not been provided. The telling is often too basic, as though the story were nothing more than a series of events. […] Yet a story lacking cultural references neither enter-tains, nor serves as a basis for accurate study. It is the lack of explanation regarding the way in which Inuit think — and therefore live now or in the past — that can destroy a story, and with it the cultural treasures it carries and conceals. […] In an age when Inuit reabsorb their own culture through print media (not a bad thing, by the way), rather than through oral tradition, they — like any audience — must trust that print to fully inform them.</p>
  <p>We should never try and be like a Qallunaak, a White man, because we will never be one.</p>
  <p>The stories are regarded as historical documents concerning events which once took place, and which are now the source of all information regarding past ages, ancient times when there was hardly any difference between men and animals.</p>
  <p>I have been consulting with people in communities about Nunavut laws in the North Baffin region and one of the recommendations I took from an elder was to end the practice of naming buildings after deceased persons. It was the same message that Mr. Irniq once wrote — it’s a foreign practice — and to this elder, it was quite painful to realize that a building was named after a deceased loved one without family consultation. The name becomes meaningless once people start referring to the building name.</p>
  <p>Il a fallu, parmi les multiples témoignages, dégager les faits historiques de ce qui relevait de la légende. Dans la plupart des récits esquimaux, […] le compte rendu des événements est parfois orné de détails légendaires, les dates restent généralement imprécises, faute de points de repère connus, et les lieux ne sont pas toujours bien déterminés. De plus, les noms de personnes eux-mêmes sont parfois difficiles à vérifier, […] le même personnage était parfois connu sous des noms différents.</p>
  <p>I was interested in finding out more information about Qaumauq as I had heard that he was a very able man. I thought that it would be very good if I were able to tell stories to my children and if I am blessed with my grandchildren, I want to be able to tell them about Qaumauq. I believe that legends start out with actual people like Qaumauq. I want to develop a story about Qaumauq so that perhaps it may become a legend.</p>
